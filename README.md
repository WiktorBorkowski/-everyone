# @everyone

A simple app that lets you quickly reach your trusted people in different situations (mental health, check-ins, other scenarios).

This repo contains the Ruby on Rails backend.

## What it does (backend)
- Stores users and their trusted contacts
- Starts a “session” when a user triggers @everyone
- Calls multiple contacts at once (first person to pick up gets connected)
- Sends SMS updates to the other contacts

## Tech
- Ruby on Rails (API / backend)
- Twilio (Voice + SMS)

## Requirements
- Ruby (match the version in `.ruby-version`)
- Bundler
- Twilio account + phone number

## Setup (local)
